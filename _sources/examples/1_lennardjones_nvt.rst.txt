Canonical ensemble simulations with Lennard-Jones
=================================================

Lennard-Jonesium in the canonical ensemble (NVT) is a historically important system, first studied by Rahman [1]. The number of particles is held constant by allowing translational moves only, and the volume is typically fixed using periodic boundary conditions.
